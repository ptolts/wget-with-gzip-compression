.SH "NAME"
Wget \- The non\-interactive network downloader.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
wget [\fIoption\fR]... [\fI\s-1URL\s0\fR]...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\s-1GNU\s0 Wget is a free utility for non-interactive download of files from
the Web.  It supports \s-1HTTP\s0, \s-1HTTPS\s0, and \s-1FTP\s0 protocols, as
well as retrieval through \s-1HTTP\s0 proxies.
.PP
Wget is non-interactive, meaning that it can work in the background,
while the user is not logged on.  This allows you to start a retrieval
and disconnect from the system, letting Wget finish the work.  By
contrast, most of the Web browsers require constant user's presence,
which can be a great hindrance when transferring a lot of data.
.PP
Wget can follow links in \s-1HTML\s0 and \s-1XHTML\s0 pages and create local 
versions of remote web sites, fully recreating the directory structure of 
the original site.  This is sometimes referred to as ``recursive
downloading.''  While doing that, Wget respects the Robot Exclusion
Standard (\fI/robots.txt\fR).  Wget can be instructed to convert the
links in downloaded \s-1HTML\s0 files to the local files for offline
viewing.
.PP
Wget has been designed for robustness over slow or unstable network
connections; if a download fails due to a network problem, it will
keep retrying until the whole file has been retrieved.  If the server
supports regetting, it will instruct the server to continue the
download from where it left off.

harm if it is)\-\-\-it is enough if the URLs are just listed
sequentially.
.Sp
However, if you specify \fB\-\-force\-html\fR, the document will be
regarded as \fBhtml\fR.  In that case you may have problems with
relative links, which you can solve either by adding \f(CW\*(C`<base

already exists, it will be overwritten.  If the \fIfile\fR is \fB\-\fR,
the documents will be written to standard output.  Including this option
automatically sets the number of tries to 1.
.IP "\fB\-nc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nc"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-clobber\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-clobber"
.PD
If a file is downloaded more than once in the same directory, Wget's
behavior depends on a few options, including \fB\-nc\fR.  In certain
cases, the local file will be \fIclobbered\fR, or overwritten, upon
repeated download.  In other cases it will be preserved.
.Sp
When running Wget without \fB\-N\fR, \fB\-nc\fR, or \fB\-r\fR,
downloading the same file in the same directory will result in the
original copy of \fIfile\fR being preserved and the second copy being
named \fIfile\fR\fB.1\fR.  If that file is downloaded yet again, the
third copy will be named \fIfile\fR\fB.2\fR, and so on.  When
\&\fB\-nc\fR is specified, this behavior is suppressed, and Wget will
refuse to download newer copies of \fIfile\fR.  Therefore,
``\f(CW\*(C`no\-clobber\*(C'\fR'' is actually a misnomer in this mode\-\-\-it's not
clobbering that's prevented (as the numeric suffixes were already
preventing clobbering), but rather the multiple version saving that's
prevented.
.Sp
When running Wget with \fB\-r\fR, but without \fB\-N\fR or \fB\-nc\fR,
re-downloading a file will result in the new copy simply overwriting the
old.  Adding \fB\-nc\fR will prevent this behavior, instead causing the
original version to be preserved and any newer copies on the server to
be ignored.
.Sp
When running Wget with \fB\-N\fR, with or without \fB\-r\fR, the
decision as to whether or not to download a newer copy of a file depends
on the local and remote timestamp and size of the file.  \fB\-nc\fR may not be specified at the same
time as \fB\-N\fR.
.Sp
Note that when \fB\-nc\fR is specified, files with the suffixes
\&\fB.html\fR or (yuck) \fB.htm\fR will be loaded from the local disk
and parsed as if they had been retrieved from the Web.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-continue\fR" 4
.IX Item "--continue"
.PD
Continue getting a partially-downloaded file.  This is useful when you
want to finish up a download started by a previous instance of Wget, or
by another program.  For instance:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        wget \-c ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/ls\-lR.Z
.Ve
.Sp
If there is a file named \fIls\-lR.Z\fR in the current directory, Wget
will assume that it is the first portion of the remote file, and will
ask the server to continue the retrieval from an offset equal to the
length of the local file.
.Sp
Note that you don't need to specify this option if you just want the
current invocation of Wget to retry downloading a file should the
connection be lost midway through.  This is the default behavior.
\&\fB\-c\fR only affects resumption of downloads started \fIprior\fR to
this invocation of Wget, and whose local files are still sitting around.
.Sp
Without \fB\-c\fR, the previous example would just download the remote
file to \fIls\-lR.Z.1\fR, leaving the truncated \fIls\-lR.Z\fR file
alone.
.Sp
Beginning with Wget 1.7, if you use \fB\-c\fR on a non-empty file, and
it turns out that the server does not support continued downloading,
Wget will refuse to start the download from scratch, which would
effectively ruin existing contents.  If you really want the download to
start from scratch, remove the file.
.Sp
Also beginning with Wget 1.7, if you use \fB\-c\fR on a file which is of
equal size as the one on the server, Wget will refuse to download the
file and print an explanatory message.  The same happens when the file
is smaller on the server than locally (presumably because it was changed
on the server since your last download attempt)\-\-\-because ``continuing''
is not meaningful, no download occurs.
.Sp
On the other side of the coin, while using \fB\-c\fR, any file that's
bigger on the server than locally will be considered an incomplete
download and only \f(CW\*(C`(length(remote) \- length(local))\*(C'\fR bytes will be
downloaded and tacked onto the end of the local file.  This behavior can
be desirable in certain cases\-\-\-for instance, you can use \fBwget \-c\fR
to download just the new portion that's been appended to a data
collection or log file.
.Sp
However, if the file is bigger on the server because it's been
\&\fIchanged\fR, as opposed to just \fIappended\fR to, you'll end up
with a garbled file.  Wget has no way of verifying that the local file
is really a valid prefix of the remote file.  You need to be especially
careful of this when using \fB\-c\fR in conjunction with \fB\-r\fR,
since every file will be considered as an \*(L"incomplete download\*(R" candidate.
.Sp
Another instance where you'll get a garbled file if you try to use
\&\fB\-c\fR is if you have a lame \s-1HTTP\s0 proxy that inserts a
``transfer interrupted'' string into the local file.  In the future a
``rollback'' option may be added to deal with this case.
.Sp
Note that \fB\-c\fR only works with \s-1FTP\s0 servers and with \s-1HTTP\s0
servers that support the \f(CW\*(C`Range\*(C'\fR header.
.IP "\fB\-\-progress=\fR\fItype\fR" 4
.IX Item "--progress=type"
Select the type of the progress indicator you wish to use.  Legal
indicators are ``dot'' and ``bar''.
.Sp
The ``bar'' indicator is used by default.  It draws an \s-1ASCII\s0 progress
bar graphics (a.k.a ``thermometer'' display) indicating the status of
retrieval.  If the output is not a \s-1TTY\s0, the ``dot'' bar will be used by
default.
.Sp
Use \fB\-\-progress=dot\fR to switch to the ``dot'' display.  It traces
the retrieval by printing dots on the screen, each dot representing a
fixed amount of downloaded data.
.Sp
When using the dotted retrieval, you may also set the \fIstyle\fR by
specifying the type as \fBdot:\fR\fIstyle\fR.  Different styles assign
different meaning to one dot.  With the \f(CW\*(C`default\*(C'\fR style each dot
represents 1K, there are ten dots in a cluster and 50 dots in a line.
The \f(CW\*(C`binary\*(C'\fR style has a more ``computer''\-like orientation\-\-\-8K
dots, 16\-dots clusters and 48 dots per line (which makes for 384K
lines).  The \f(CW\*(C`mega\*(C'\fR style is suitable for downloading very large
files\-\-\-each dot represents 64K retrieved, there are eight dots in a
cluster, and 48 dots on each line (so each line contains 3M).
.Sp
Note that you can set the default style using the \f(CW\*(C`progress\*(C'\fR
command in \fI.wgetrc\fR.  That setting may be overridden from the
command line.  The exception is that, when the output is not a \s-1TTY\s0, the
``dot'' progress will be favored over ``bar''.  To force the bar output,
use \fB\-\-progress=bar:force\fR.

When invoked with this option, Wget will behave as a Web \fIspider\fR,
which means that it will not download the pages, just check that they
are there.  For example, you can use Wget to check your bookmarks:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        wget \-\-spider \-\-force\-html \-i bookmarks.html
.Ve
.Sp
This feature needs much more work for Wget to get close to the

.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-timeout=\fR\fIseconds\fR" 4
.IX Item "--timeout=seconds"
.PD
Set the network timeout to \fIseconds\fR seconds.  This is equivalent
to specifying \fB\-\-dns\-timeout\fR, \fB\-\-connect\-timeout\fR, and
\&\fB\-\-read\-timeout\fR, all at the same time.
.Sp
Whenever Wget connects to or reads from a remote host, it checks for a
timeout and aborts the operation if the time expires.  This prevents
anomalous occurrences such as hanging reads or infinite connects.  The
only timeout enabled by default is a 900\-second timeout for reading.
Setting timeout to 0 disables checking for timeouts.
.Sp
Unless you know what you are doing, it is best not to set any of the
timeout-related options.
.IP "\fB\-\-dns\-timeout=\fR\fIseconds\fR" 4
.IX Item "--dns-timeout=seconds"
Set the \s-1DNS\s0 lookup timeout to \fIseconds\fR seconds.  \s-1DNS\s0 lookups that
don't complete within the specified time will fail.  By default, there
is no timeout on \s-1DNS\s0 lookups, other than that implemented by system
libraries.
.IP "\fB\-\-connect\-timeout=\fR\fIseconds\fR" 4
.IX Item "--connect-timeout=seconds"
Set the connect timeout to \fIseconds\fR seconds.  \s-1TCP\s0 connections that
take longer to establish will be aborted.  By default, there is no
connect timeout, other than that implemented by system libraries.
.IP "\fB\-\-read\-timeout=\fR\fIseconds\fR" 4
.IX Item "--read-timeout=seconds"
Set the read (and write) timeout to \fIseconds\fR seconds.  Reads that
take longer will fail.  The default value for read timeout is 900
seconds.
.IP "\fB\-\-limit\-rate=\fR\fIamount\fR" 4
.IX Item "--limit-rate=amount"
Limit the download speed to \fIamount\fR bytes per second.  Amount may
be expressed in bytes, kilobytes with the \fBk\fR suffix, or megabytes
with the \fBm\fR suffix.  For example, \fB\-\-limit\-rate=20k\fR will
limit the retrieval rate to 20KB/s.  This kind of thing is useful when,
for whatever reason, you don't want Wget to consume the entire available
bandwidth.
.Sp
Note that Wget implements the limiting by sleeping the appropriate
amount of time after a network read that took less time than specified
by the rate.  Eventually this strategy causes the \s-1TCP\s0 transfer to slow
down to approximately the specified rate.  However, it may take some
time for this balance to be achieved, so don't be surprised if limiting
the rate doesn't work well with very small files.
.IP "\fB\-w\fR \fIseconds\fR" 4

.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-wait=\fR\fIseconds\fR" 4
.IX Item "--wait=seconds"
.PD
Wait the specified number of seconds between the retrievals.  Use of
this option is recommended, as it lightens the server load by making the
requests less frequent.  Instead of in seconds, the time can be
specified in minutes using the \f(CW\*(C`m\*(C'\fR suffix, in hours using \f(CW\*(C`h\*(C'\fR
suffix, or in days using \f(CW\*(C`d\*(C'\fR suffix.
.Sp
Specifying a large value for this option is useful if the network or the
destination host is down, so that Wget can wait long enough to
reasonably expect the network error to be fixed before the retry.
.IP "\fB\-\-waitretry=\fR\fIseconds\fR" 4
.IX Item "--waitretry=seconds"
If you don't want Wget to wait between \fIevery\fR retrieval, but only
between retries of failed downloads, you can use this option.  Wget will
use \fIlinear backoff\fR, waiting 1 second after the first failure on a

Some web sites may perform log analysis to identify retrieval programs
such as Wget by looking for statistically significant similarities in
the time between requests. This option causes the time between requests
to vary between 0 and 2 * \fIwait\fR seconds, where \fIwait\fR was
specified using the \fB\-\-wait\fR option, in order to mask Wget's
presence from such analysis.
.Sp
A recent article in a publication devoted to development on a popular
consumer platform provided code to perform this analysis on the fly.
Its author suggested blocking at the class C address level to ensure
automated retrieval programs were blocked despite changing DHCP-supplied
addresses.
.Sp
The \fB\-\-random\-wait\fR option was inspired by this ill-advised
recommendation to block many unrelated users from a web site due to the
actions of one.

Specify download quota for automatic retrievals.  The value can be
specified in bytes (default), kilobytes (with \fBk\fR suffix), or
megabytes (with \fBm\fR suffix).
.Sp
Note that quota will never affect downloading a single file.  So if you
specify \fBwget \-Q10k ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/ls\-lR.gz\fR, all of the
\&\fIls\-lR.gz\fR will be downloaded.  The same goes even when several
URLs are specified on the command-line.  However, quota is
respected when retrieving either recursively, or from an input file.
Thus you may safely type \fBwget \-Q2m \-i sites\fR\-\-\-download will be

Setting quota to 0 or to \fBinf\fR unlimits the download quota.
.IP "\fB\-\-dns\-cache=off\fR" 4
.IX Item "--dns-cache=off"
Turn off caching of \s-1DNS\s0 lookups.  Normally, Wget remembers the addresses
it looked up from \s-1DNS\s0 so it doesn't have to repeatedly contact the \s-1DNS\s0
server for the same (typically small) set of addresses it retrieves
from.  This cache exists in memory only; a new Wget run will contact \s-1DNS\s0
again.
.Sp
However, in some cases it is not desirable to cache host names, even for
the duration of a short-running application like Wget.  For example,
some \s-1HTTP\s0 servers are hosted on machines with dynamically allocated \s-1IP\s0
addresses that change from time to time.  Their \s-1DNS\s0 entries are updated
along with each change.  When Wget's download from such a host gets
interrupted by \s-1IP\s0 address change, Wget retries the download, but (due to
\&\s-1DNS\s0 caching) it contacts the old address.  With the \s-1DNS\s0 cache turned
off, Wget will repeat the \s-1DNS\s0 lookup for every connect and will thus get
the correct dynamic address every time\-\-\-at the cost of additional \s-1DNS\s0
lookups where they're probably not needed.
.Sp
If you don't understand the above description, you probably won't need
this option.
.IP "\fB\-\-restrict\-file\-names=\fR\fImode\fR" 4
.IX Item "--restrict-file-names=mode"
Change which characters found in remote URLs may show up in local file
names generated from those URLs.  Characters that are \fIrestricted\fR
by this option are escaped, i.e. replaced with \fB\f(CB%HH\fB\fR, where
\&\fB\s-1HH\s0\fR is the hexadecimal number that corresponds to the restricted
character.
.Sp
By default, Wget escapes the characters that are not valid as part of
file names on your operating system, as well as control characters that
are typically unprintable.  This option is useful for changing these
defaults, either because you are downloading to a non-native partition,
or because you want to disable escaping of the control characters.
.Sp
When mode is set to ``unix'', Wget escapes the character \fB/\fR and
the control characters in the ranges 0\-\-31 and 128\-\-159.  This is the
default on Unix-like \s-1OS\s0'es.
.Sp
When mode is set to ``windows'', Wget escapes the characters \fB\e\fR,
\&\fB|\fR, \fB/\fR, \fB:\fR, \fB?\fR, \fB"\fR, \fB*\fR, \fB<\fR,
\&\fB>\fR, and the control characters in the ranges 0\-\-31 and 128\-\-159.
In addition to this, Wget in Windows mode uses \fB+\fR instead of
\&\fB:\fR to separate host and port in local file names, and uses
\&\fB@} instead of \f(CB@samp\fB{?\fR to separate the query portion of the file
name from the rest.  Therefore, a \s-1URL\s0 that would be saved as
\&\fBwww.xemacs.org:4300/search.pl?input=blah\fR in Unix mode would be
saved as \fBwww.xemacs.org+4300/search.pl@input=blah\fR in Windows
mode.  This mode is the default on Windows.
.Sp
If you append \fB,nocontrol\fR to the mode, as in
\&\fBunix,nocontrol\fR, escaping of the control characters is also
switched off.  You can use \fB\-\-restrict\-file\-names=nocontrol\fR to
turn off escaping of control characters without affecting the choice of
the \s-1OS\s0 to use as file name restriction mode.

.Sp
Take, for example, the directory at

remove the \fIftp.xemacs.org/\fR part, you are still stuck with
\&\fIpub/xemacs\fR.  This is where \fB\-\-cut\-dirs\fR comes in handy; it

If a file of type \fBapplication/xhtml+xml\fR or \fBtext/html\fR is

you're mirroring a remote site that uses \fB.asp\fR pages, but you want 
the mirrored pages to be viewable on your stock Apache server.  Another 
good use for this is when you're downloading CGI-generated materials.  A \s-1URL\s0

Note that filenames changed in this way will be re-downloaded every time
you re-mirror a site, because Wget can't tell that the local

it doesn't yet know that the \s-1URL\s0 produces output of type

You will typically use this option when mirroring sites that require
that you be logged in to access some or all of their content.  The login
process typically works by the web server issuing an \s-1HTTP\s0 cookie

resent by the browser when accessing that part of the site, and so
proves your identity.

Use \s-1POST\s0 as the method for all \s-1HTTP\s0 requests and send the specified data

whereas \f(CW\*(C`\-\-post\-file\*(C'\fR sends the contents of \fIfile\fR.  Other than
that, they work in exactly the same way.
.Sp
Please be aware that Wget needs to know the size of the \s-1POST\s0 data in
advance.  Therefore the argument to \f(CW\*(C`\-\-post\-file\*(C'\fR must be a regular
file; specifying a \s-1FIFO\s0 or something like \fI/dev/stdin\fR won't work.
It's not quite clear how to work around this limitation inherent in
\&\s-1HTTP/1\s0.0.  Although \s-1HTTP/1\s0.1 introduces \fIchunked\fR transfer that
doesn't require knowing the request length in advance, a client can't
use chunked unless it knows it's talking to an \s-1HTTP/1\s0.1 server.  And it
can't know that until it receives a response, which in turn requires the
request to have been completed \*(-- a chicken-and-egg problem.
.Sp
Note: if Wget is redirected after the \s-1POST\s0 request is completed, it will
not send the \s-1POST\s0 data to the redirected \s-1URL\s0.  This is because URLs that
process \s-1POST\s0 often respond with a redirection to a regular page
(although that's technically disallowed), which does not desire or
accept \s-1POST\s0.  It is not yet clear that this behavior is optimal; if it
doesn't work out, it will be changed.

asking \f(CW\*(C`root\*(C'\fR to run Wget in his or her directory.  Depending on

.IX Item "-r"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-recursive\fR" 4
.IX Item "--recursive"
.PD
Turn on recursive retrieving.
.IP "\fB\-l\fR \fIdepth\fR" 4
.IX Item "-l depth"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-level=\fR\fIdepth\fR" 4
.IX Item "--level=depth"
.PD
Specify recursion maximum depth level \fIdepth\fR.  The default maximum depth is 5.
.IP "\fB\-\-delete\-after\fR" 4
.IX Item "--delete-after"
This option tells Wget to delete every single file it downloads,
\&\fIafter\fR having done so.  It is useful for pre-fetching popular
pages through a proxy, e.g.:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        wget \-r \-nd \-\-delete\-after http://whatever.com/~popular/page/
.Ve
.Sp
The \fB\-r\fR option is to retrieve recursively, and \fB\-nd\fR to not
create directories.
.Sp
Note that \fB\-\-delete\-after\fR deletes files on the local machine.  It
does not issue the \fB\s-1DELE\s0\fR command to remote \s-1FTP\s0 sites, for
instance.  Also note that when \fB\-\-delete\-after\fR is specified,
\&\fB\-\-convert\-links\fR is ignored, so \fB.orig\fR files are simply not
created in the first place.
.IP "\fB\-k\fR" 4
.IX Item "-k"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-convert\-links\fR" 4
.IX Item "--convert-links"
.PD
After the download is complete, convert the links in the document to
make them suitable for local viewing.  This affects not only the visible
hyperlinks, but any part of the document that links to external content,
such as embedded images, links to style sheets, hyperlinks to non-HTML
content, etc.
.Sp
Each link will be changed in one of the two ways:
.RS 4
.IP "\(bu" 4
The links to files that have been downloaded by Wget will be changed to
refer to the file they point to as a relative link.
.Sp
Example: if the downloaded file \fI/foo/doc.html\fR links to
\&\fI/bar/img.gif\fR, also downloaded, then the link in \fIdoc.html\fR
will be modified to point to \fB../bar/img.gif\fR.  This kind of
transformation works reliably for arbitrary combinations of directories.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The links to files that have not been downloaded by Wget will be changed
to include host name and absolute path of the location they point to.
.Sp
Example: if the downloaded file \fI/foo/doc.html\fR links to
\&\fI/bar/img.gif\fR (or to \fI../bar/img.gif\fR), then the link in
\&\fIdoc.html\fR will be modified to point to
\&\fIhttp://\fIhostname\fI/bar/img.gif\fR.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
Because of this, local browsing works reliably: if a linked file was
downloaded, the link will refer to its local name; if it was not
downloaded, the link will refer to its full Internet address rather than
presenting a broken link.  The fact that the former links are converted
to relative links ensures that you can move the downloaded hierarchy to
another directory.
.Sp
Note that only at the end of the download can Wget know which links have
been downloaded.  Because of that, the work done by \fB\-k\fR will be
performed at the end of all the downloads.
.RE
.IP "\fB\-K\fR" 4
.IX Item "-K"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-backup\-converted\fR" 4
.IX Item "--backup-converted"
.PD
When converting a file, back up the original version with a \fB.orig\fR
suffix.  Affects the behavior of \fB\-N\fR.
.IP "\fB\-m\fR" 4
.IX Item "-m"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-mirror\fR" 4
.IX Item "--mirror"
.PD
Turn on options suitable for mirroring.  This option turns on recursion
and time-stamping, sets infinite recursion depth and keeps \s-1FTP\s0
directory listings.  It is currently equivalent to
\&\fB\-r \-N \-l inf \-nr\fR.
.IP "\fB\-p\fR" 4
.IX Item "-p"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-page\-requisites\fR" 4
.IX Item "--page-requisites"
.PD
This option causes Wget to download all the files that are necessary to
properly display a given \s-1HTML\s0 page.  This includes such things as
inlined images, sounds, and referenced stylesheets.
.Sp
Ordinarily, when downloading a single \s-1HTML\s0 page, any requisite documents
that may be needed to display it properly are not downloaded.  Using
\&\fB\-r\fR together with \fB\-l\fR can help, but since Wget does not
ordinarily distinguish between external and inlined documents, one is
generally left with ``leaf documents'' that are missing their
requisites.
.Sp
For instance, say document \fI1.html\fR contains an \f(CW\*(C`<IMG>\*(C'\fR tag
referencing \fI1.gif\fR and an \f(CW\*(C`<A>\*(C'\fR tag pointing to external
document \fI2.html\fR.  Say that \fI2.html\fR is similar but that its
image is \fI2.gif\fR and it links to \fI3.html\fR.  Say this
continues up to some arbitrarily high number.
.Sp
If one executes the command:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        wget \-r \-l 2 http://<site>/1.html
.Ve
.Sp
then \fI1.html\fR, \fI1.gif\fR, \fI2.html\fR, \fI2.gif\fR, and
\&\fI3.html\fR will be downloaded.  As you can see, \fI3.html\fR is
without its requisite \fI3.gif\fR because Wget is simply counting the
number of hops (up to 2) away from \fI1.html\fR in order to determine
where to stop the recursion.  However, with this command:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        wget \-r \-l 2 \-p http://<site>/1.html
.Ve
.Sp
all the above files \fIand\fR \fI3.html\fR's requisite \fI3.gif\fR
will be downloaded.  Similarly,
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        wget \-r \-l 1 \-p http://<site>/1.html
.Ve
.Sp
will cause \fI1.html\fR, \fI1.gif\fR, \fI2.html\fR, and \fI2.gif\fR
to be downloaded.  One might think that:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        wget \-r \-l 0 \-p http://<site>/1.html
.Ve
.Sp
would download just \fI1.html\fR and \fI1.gif\fR, but unfortunately
this is not the case, because \fB\-l 0\fR is equivalent to
\&\fB\-l inf\fR\-\-\-that is, infinite recursion.  To download a single \s-1HTML\s0
page (or a handful of them, all specified on the command-line or in a
\&\fB\-i\fR \s-1URL\s0 input file) and its (or their) requisites, simply leave off
\&\fB\-r\fR and \fB\-l\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        wget \-p http://<site>/1.html
.Ve
.Sp
Note that Wget will behave as if \fB\-r\fR had been specified, but only
that single page and its requisites will be downloaded.  Links from that
page to external documents will not be followed.  Actually, to download
a single page and all its requisites (even if they exist on separate
websites), and make sure the lot displays properly locally, this author
likes to use a few options in addition to \fB\-p\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        wget \-E \-H \-k \-K \-p http://<site>/<document>
.Ve
.Sp
To finish off this topic, it's worth knowing that Wget's idea of an
external document link is any \s-1URL\s0 specified in an \f(CW\*(C`<A>\*(C'\fR tag, an
\&\f(CW\*(C`<AREA>\*(C'\fR tag, or a \f(CW\*(C`<LINK>\*(C'\fR tag other than \f(CW\*(C`<LINK
REL="stylesheet">\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-strict\-comments\fR" 4
.IX Item "--strict-comments"
Turn on strict parsing of \s-1HTML\s0 comments.  The default is to terminate
comments at the first occurrence of \fB\-\->\fR.
.Sp
According to specifications, \s-1HTML\s0 comments are expressed as \s-1SGML\s0
\&\fIdeclarations\fR.  Declaration is special markup that begins with
\&\fB<!\fR and ends with \fB>\fR, such as \fB<!DOCTYPE ...>\fR, that
may contain comments between a pair of \fB\-\-\fR delimiters.  \s-1HTML\s0
comments are ``empty declarations'', \s-1SGML\s0 declarations without any
non-comment text.  Therefore, \fB<!\-\-foo\-\->\fR is a valid comment, and
so is \fB<!\-\-one\*(-- \-\-two\-\->\fR, but \fB<!\-\-1\-\-2\-\->\fR is not.
.Sp
On the other hand, most \s-1HTML\s0 writers don't perceive comments as anything
other than text delimited with \fB<!\-\-\fR and \fB\-\->\fR, which is not
quite the same.  For example, something like \fB<!\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\->\fR
works as a valid comment as long as the number of dashes is a multiple
of four (!).  If not, the comment technically lasts until the next
\&\fB\-\-\fR, which may be at the other end of the document.  Because of
this, many popular browsers completely ignore the specification and
implement what users have come to expect: comments delimited with
\&\fB<!\-\-\fR and \fB\-\->\fR.
.Sp
Until version 1.9, Wget interpreted comments strictly, which resulted in
missing links in many web pages that displayed fine in browsers, but had
the misfortune of containing non-compliant comments.  Beginning with
version 1.9, Wget has joined the ranks of clients that implements
``naive'' comments, terminating each comment at the first occurrence of
\&\fB\-\->\fR.
.Sp
If, for whatever reason, you want strict comment parsing, use this
option to turn it on.

.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-R\fR \fIrejlist\fR \fB\-\-reject\fR \fIrejlist\fR" 4
.IX Item "-R rejlist --reject rejlist"
.PD
Specify comma-separated lists of file name suffixes or patterns to
accept or reject (@pxref{Types of Files} for more details).
.IP "\fB\-D\fR \fIdomain-list\fR" 4
.IX Item "-D domain-list"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-domains=\fR\fIdomain-list\fR" 4
.IX Item "--domains=domain-list"
.PD
Set domains to be followed.  \fIdomain-list\fR is a comma-separated list
of domains.  Note that it does \fInot\fR turn on \fB\-H\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-exclude\-domains\fR \fIdomain-list\fR" 4
.IX Item "--exclude-domains domain-list"
Specify the domains that are \fInot\fR to be followed..
.IP "\fB\-\-follow\-ftp\fR" 4
.IX Item "--follow-ftp"
Follow \s-1FTP\s0 links from \s-1HTML\s0 documents.  Without this option,
Wget will ignore all the \s-1FTP\s0 links.
.IP "\fB\-\-follow\-tags=\fR\fIlist\fR" 4
.IX Item "--follow-tags=list"
Wget has an internal table of \s-1HTML\s0 tag / attribute pairs that it
considers when looking for linked documents during a recursive
retrieval.  If a user wants only a subset of those tags to be
considered, however, he or she should be specify such tags in a
comma-separated \fIlist\fR with this option.
.IP "\fB\-G\fR \fIlist\fR" 4
.IX Item "-G list"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-ignore\-tags=\fR\fIlist\fR" 4
.IX Item "--ignore-tags=list"
.PD
This is the opposite of the \fB\-\-follow\-tags\fR option.  To skip
certain \s-1HTML\s0 tags when recursively looking for documents to download,
specify them in a comma-separated \fIlist\fR.
.Sp
In the past, the \fB\-G\fR option was the best bet for downloading a
single page and its requisites, using a command-line like:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        wget \-Ga,area \-H \-k \-K \-r http://<site>/<document>
.Ve
.Sp
However, the author of this option came across a page with tags like
\&\f(CW\*(C`<LINK REL="home" HREF="/">\*(C'\fR and came to the realization that
\&\fB\-G\fR was not enough.  One can't just tell Wget to ignore
\&\f(CW\*(C`<LINK>\*(C'\fR, because then stylesheets will not be downloaded.  Now the
best bet for downloading a single page and its requisites is the
dedicated \fB\-\-page\-requisites\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-H\fR" 4
.IX Item "-H"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-span\-hosts\fR" 4

Enable spanning across hosts when doing recursive retrieving.
.IP "\fB\-L\fR" 4
.IX Item "-L"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-relative\fR" 4
.IX Item "--relative"
.PD
Follow relative links only.  Useful for retrieving a specific home page
without any distractions, not even those from the same hosts.
.IP "\fB\-I\fR \fIlist\fR" 4
.IX Item "-I list"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-include\-directories=\fR\fIlist\fR" 4
.IX Item "--include-directories=list"
.PD
Specify a comma-separated list of directories you wish to follow when
downloading (@pxref{Directory\-Based Limits} for more details.)  Elements
of \fIlist\fR may contain wildcards.
.IP "\fB\-X\fR \fIlist\fR" 4
.IX Item "-X list"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-exclude\-directories=\fR\fIlist\fR" 4
.IX Item "--exclude-directories=list"
.PD
Specify a comma-separated list of directories you wish to exclude from
download (@pxref{Directory\-Based Limits} for more details.)  Elements of
\&\fIlist\fR may contain wildcards.
.IP "\fB\-np\fR" 4
.IX Item "-np"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-parent\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-parent"
.PD
Do not ever ascend to the parent directory when retrieving recursively.
This is a useful option, since it guarantees that only the files

.SH "BUGS"
.IX Header "BUGS"
You are welcome to send bug reports about \s-1GNU\s0 Wget to
<\fBbug\-wget@gnu.org\fR>.
.PP
Before actually submitting a bug report, please try to follow a few
simple guidelines.
.IP "1." 4
Please try to ascertain that the behavior you see really is a bug.  If
Wget crashes, it's a bug.  If Wget does not behave as documented,
it's a bug.  If things work strange, but you are not sure about the way
they are supposed to work, it might well be a bug.
.IP "2." 4
Try to repeat the bug in as simple circumstances as possible.  E.g. if
Wget crashes while downloading \fBwget \-rl0 \-kKE \-t5 \-Y0
http://yoyodyne.com \-o /tmp/log\fR, you should try to see if the crash is
repeatable, and if will occur with a simpler set of options.  You might
even try to start the download at the page where the crash occurred to
see if that page somehow triggered the crash.
.Sp
Also, while I will probably be interested to know the contents of your
\&\fI.wgetrc\fR file, just dumping it into the debug message is probably
a bad idea.  Instead, you should first try to see if the bug repeats
with \fI.wgetrc\fR moved out of the way.  Only if it turns out that
\&\fI.wgetrc\fR settings affect the bug, mail me the relevant parts of
the file.
.IP "3." 4
Please start Wget with \fB\-d\fR option and send the log (or the
relevant parts of it).  If Wget was compiled without debug support,
recompile it.  It is \fImuch\fR easier to trace bugs with debug support
on.
.IP "4." 4
If Wget has crashed, try to run it in a debugger, e.g. \f(CW\*(C`gdb \`which
wget\` core\*(C'\fR and type \f(CW\*(C`where\*(C'\fR to get the backtrace.
